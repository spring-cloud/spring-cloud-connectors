Spring Cloud Core Library
=========================

The core library to let cloud applications access application information and services.
While Spring applications is one of the main target for this library, it may be used in 
non-Spring projects as well. In fact, **this library doesn't even depend on Spring**.

This library is cloud-agnostic. Through connectors, it supports multiple clouds 
(with Cloud Foundry and Heroku as the example clouds).

This library also supports an extension to create services connectors of user-desired types.

Usage pattern: Application Developers
=====================================

* Create a [`CloudFactory`](src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/CloudFactory.java) instance. 
  Creation of a `CloudFactory` instance is a bit expensive, so caching such an instance is recommended.
  If you are using a dependency inject frameworks such as Spring, creating a bean for `CloudFactory`
  will achieve the caching effect.

    ```java
    CloudFactory cloudFactory = new CloudFactory();
    ```
* Obtain a suitable [`Cloud`](src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/Cloud.java) for the environment 
  in which the application is running.
  
    ```java
    Cloud cloud = cloudFactory.getCloud();
    ```

* Use the `Cloud` instance to get access to application info, service infos, and create service 
  connectors.

    ```java
    // ServiceInfo has all the information necessary to connect to the underlying service
    cloud.getServiceInfos();
    ```
    
    ```java
    // Alternatively, let the cloud create a service connector for you
    DataSource ds = cloud.getServiceConnector("inventory-db", DataSource.class, null /* default config */);
    ```
    
Usage pattern: Cloud and Service Providers
==========================================
A cloud provider may extends the functionality in two ways:

1. Add new [`CloudConnector`](src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/CloudConnector.java)s to make 
   spring-cloud related libraries work with a new cloud. 
   See [cloudfoundry-connector](../cloudfoundry-connector) 
   or [heroku-connector](../heroku-connector) for an example. 
   This is done declaratively by adding connector classes to:
    ```
    META-INF/services/org.springframework.cloud.CloudConnector
    ```
2. Add new [`ServiceConnectorCreator`](src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/service/ServiceConnectorCreator.java)s 
   to allow creation of service connector objects.	
   See [spring-service-connector](../spring-service-connector) for an example. 
   This is done declaratively by adding creator classes to: 
   ```
    META-INF/services/org.springframework.cloud.service.ServiceConnectorCreator
   ```
